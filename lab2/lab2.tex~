    \section*{Abstract}

    In this exercise, the behaviour of RTL and SEL inverters was investigated by
    simulating the circuits in SPICE. The effects of varying different parameters
    inside the load device (resistance and load transistor strength) was investigated.
    VTC curves were shown for both of the inverter types as well as plots for inverter
    response due to varying parameters.\\

    \section*{Saturated enhancement-load inverter}

    The POST routine was used to test the existence of a wave. To test the actual timer,
    various frequencies were tested to see if the buckets filled around the generated
    frequency. The sum of all buckets was verified to equal $1000$.\\

    To test the UART portion, the limits of the input were tested as well as invalid
    inputs. The \code{DEL} ASCII code was tested to be handled properly during getline
    to allow the user to use backspace during inputs.

    \section*{Project Results}

    When running the program with a \SI{1}{\kilo\Hz} wave connected, I'd expect the
    output to be grouped around \SI{1000}{ms}.
    
    \begin{figure}[h!]
      %\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{s1}
      \caption{Input capture performed with a \SI{1}{\kilo\Hz} signal}
    \end{figure}

    When run again with a \SI{2}{\kilo\Hz}, I'd expect the period to be around
    \SI{500}{ms}.

    \begin{figure}[h!]
      %\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{s1}
      \caption{Input capture performed with a \SI{1}{\kilo\Hz} signal}
    \end{figure}

    Both of the tests run and output expected results.

    \section*{Lessons learned}
    I encountered two major issues while working on the project. The first issue was
    that the wave generator I was using initially was not configured to pulse to the
    correct voltage. The timer would never trip even though the wave looked correct on
    the oscilliscope. The second issue was due to my misunderstanding with how the
    timer works. I assumed that when an input event was triggered, the counter would
    be reset. Due to this assumption, the results would become very skewed after
    re-running the program a couple of times. Once I realized how the timer works
    and the reference measurement was implemented, the program worked properly.
